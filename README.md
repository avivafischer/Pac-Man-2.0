# Pac-Man 2.0

## Description
<p>Pac Man Factory: Create buttons to produce Pac Mans on the screen keeping track of the position and velocity of each Pac Man. Additionally, the Pac Man needs to bounce off any wall it hits.</p>

## How to Run
<p>Each time the button ADD PACMAN is pressed, a random pacman will appear on the screen. When the button START GAME is pressed, the pacmans will move around at different velocities, bouncing off the edges of the screen. Each additional time the START GAME button is pressed, the pacmans velocity will increase. Refresh the Page to start over.</p>

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
<p>Improvements needed to resemble a real Pac Man game.</p>
